"""
The `~plasmapy.dispersion` subpackage contains functionality associated
with plasma dispersion relations, including numerical solvers and
`~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical` solutions. Plasa dispersion dispersion 
refers to the dependence of a waveâ€™s phase velocity and group velocity on 
its frequency. This is a crucial aspect when studying wave propagation in 
plasmas, as it influences phenomena like wave-particle interactions, energy
transport, and the stability of plasma configurations.
